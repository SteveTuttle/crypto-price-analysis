## Challenge Description
### Background
For this challenge, we need to use our knowledge of Python via a Jupyter Notebook and Unsupervised Learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

## Deliverables
Our goal for this challenge is detailed a requires us to follow a series of steps broken down within six greater sections. The Challenge Instuctions are outlined within each section, and the section are to be completed as follows:
1) Prepare the Data
2) Find the Best Value for _k_ Using the Original Scaled DataFrame
3) Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Scaled Data
4) Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis
5) Find the Best Value for _k_ Using the PCA Data
6) Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data

### Section-1: Prepare the Data
To start off I needed to rename the __Crypto_Clustering_starter_code.ipynb__ file as __Crypto_Clustering_SDT.ipynb__. I viewed the file _crypto_market_data.csv_ separately first to understand the data scource better, then I loaded the _crypto_market_data.csv_ into a DataFrame. From here I am able to acquire the metrics and plot the data needed complete the challenge per the instructions:
* Use the _StandardScaler()_ module from _scikit-learn_ to normalize the data from the CSV file.
* Create a DataFrame with the scaled data and set the __"coin_id"__ index from the original DataFrame as the index for the new DataFrame.

### Section-2: Find the Best Value for k Using the Original Scaled DataFrame
In this section I will use the elbow method to find the best value for _k_ per the instructions from the challenge:
* Create a list with the number of k values from 1 to 11.
* Create an empty list to store the inertia values.
* Create a _for_ loop to compute the inertia with each possible value of _k_.
* Create a dictionary with the data to plot the elbow curve.
* Plot a line chart with all the inertia values computed with the different values of _k_ to visually identify the optimal value for _k_.
* Answer the following question in your notebook: What is the best value for _k_?

### Section-3: Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Scaled Data
For this section I will use the following steps per the challenge instructions to cluster the cryptocurrencies for the best value for _k_ of the original scaled data:
* Initialize the K-means model with the best value for _k_.
* Fit the K-means model using the original scaled DataFrame.
* Predict the clusters to group the cryptocurrencies using the original scaled DataFrame.
* Create a copy of the original data and add a new column with the predicted clusters.
* Create a scatter plot using hvPlot as follows:
  * Set the x-axis as __"PC1"__ and the y-axis as __"PC2"__.
  * Color the graph points with the labels found using K-means.
  * Add the __"coin_id"__ column in the _hover_cols_ parameter to identify the cryptocurrency represented by each data point.

### Section-4: Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis
In this section I will further refine the clusters using Principal Component Analysis (__PCA__) per the challenge instructions:
* Using the original scaled DataFrame, perform a PCA and reduce the features to three principal components.
* Retrieve the explained variance to determine how much information can be attributed to each principal component and then answer the following question in your notebook:
  * _What is the total explained variance of the three principal components_?
* Create a new DataFrame with the PCA data and set the __"coin_id"__ index from the original DataFrame as the index for the new DataFrame.

### Section-5: Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data
Following challenge instructions I will again use the elbow method on the PCA data to find the best value for _k_ by:
* Create a list with the number of k-values from 1 to 11.
* Create an empty list to store the inertia values.
* Create a _for_ loop to compute the inertia with each possible value of _k_.
* Create a dictionary with the data to plot the Elbow curve.
* Plot a line chart with all the inertia values computed with the different values of _k_ to visually identify the optimal value for _k_.
* Answer the following question in your notebook:
  * What is the best value for _k_ when using the PCA data?
  * Does it differ from the best k value found using the original data?

### Section-6: Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data
Finally, I will complete the following steps per the challenge instructions to cluster the cryptocurrencies for the best value for _k_ on the PCA data:
* Initialize the K-means model with the best value for _k_.
* Fit the K-means model using the PCA data.
* Predict the clusters to group the cryptocurrencies using the PCA data.
* Create a copy of the DataFrame with the PCA data and add a new column to store the predicted clusters.
* Create a scatter plot using hvPlot as follows:
  * Set the x-axis as __"price_change_percentage_24h"__ and the y-axis as __"price_change_percentage_7d"__.
  * Color the graph points with the labels found using K-means.
  * Add the __"coin_id"__ column in the _hover_cols_ parameter to identify the cryptocurrency represented by each data point.
* Answer the following question:
  * What is the impact of using fewer features to cluster the data using K-Means?
